## Usage

Make sure to change the config.json to your stuff

```json
{
    "version": "3.2.8",
    "token": "MTEzNzQ4NDA0NTUwMTA5MjAxMg...",
    "channel": "1208536848637624343",
    "logs": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/",
    "detections": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/",
    "errors": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/"
}
```

This works by using the api (a bit slower)
